Maria said that it was her car.\n\nExplanation\n\nThe correct answer is, \"Maria said that it was her car.\" In indirect speech, we change the pronouns and verb tenses to match the perspective of the person reporting the speech. Since the speaker  is referring to Maria  in the third person, the pronoun \"my\" changes to \"her.\" Additionally, the present tense \"is\" changes to the past tense \"was\" to reflect the change in time.\n"

My brother said that he had gone to school the previous day.\n\nExplanation\nThe correct answer is \"My brother said that he had gone to school the previous day.\" This is the correct conversion into indirect speech because the original statement \"I went to school yesterday\" is being reported in the past tense. Additionally, the word \"yesterday\" is changed to \"the previous day\" to maintain the correct sequence of events in the reported speech.\n"

                                "Correct Answer\n\nA. Mary says that she is coming there.\n\nExplanation\nThe conversion into indirect speech involves reporting what someone else has said without using their exact words. In this case, the original direct speech is \"I am coming here\" spoken by Mary. To convert this into indirect speech, we use a reporting verb (\"says\" or \"said\") and adjust the pronouns and verb tense to reflect the change in perspective and time. In the indirect speech, \"says\" can be changed to \"said\" if the reporting is happening in the past tense, which is the case in the given options. Additionally, the pronoun \"I\" changes to \"she\" to reflect the change from Mary's perspective to the perspective of the narrator/reporter. Finally, the verb tense \"am coming\" changes to \"is coming\" to maintain grammatical correctness. Therefore, the correct conversion is \"Mary says that she is coming there.\" This accurately reflects Mary's statement in indirect speech.\n\n"
